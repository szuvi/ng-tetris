# Ng Tetris

This is my try on creating game using [ngx-tetris](https://github.com/chrum/ngx-tetris) module.

## Known bugs:

- sorting and filtering game history works only on select change, not all the time
- since spacebar is set fot start/pause/reset using mouse click for controls first and then using spacebar triggers last pressed key each time

## TODO:

- add more points for multiple lines, combos points
- add history option in mobile view
- adjust layout for smaller screens
